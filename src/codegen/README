This is python bindings code generation suite for the ovirt-engine-sdk
the genparams.py will call generateDS to generate the original code, and then
it will edit the original code to generate the final code. the final code was
dependented on the confiure of paramsconf.py.

how to use the genparams.py
1. [pip-python install generateDS (if not installed)]
2. run "./genparams.py --help" to show the usage how to use this tool
3. run "./genparams.py api.xsd -o path/params.py --logfile genlog.log"
4. this tool will generate two files params.py.in(in fact is was generated by
   generateDS), and params.py. params.py was the final code.
5. run "vimdiff params.py.in params.py", to check the difference. Of courese you
   can use other diff tools.

how to configure the paramsconf.py
1. add extra import modules, please put them into the "modules" list in
   paramsconf.py file
2. add a function of class, please put them into the "addfunctionlist"
   dictionary. the key is the class name, the value is the function which you
   want to add.
3. add a global function, please put them into "globalfunctionlist" list
4. replace the functions with the same names in params.py, please input them
   into "substitutefunctionlist" list.
   the key of substitutefunctionlist, is the function name.
   the fist argument in value list is the contents of the new function.
   second argument in value list is the class which function belongs to,
   if none, means the function is a global function.
